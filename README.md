<p>We are close to finishing a new quarter of sales, income and expenses - also lawsuits -, with the figure of&nbsp;500 million iPhones sold&nbsp;pending confirmation.&nbsp;We could say that all this&nbsp;success story&nbsp;began with the first iPhone, therefore it is always interesting to know details of where and how it was created.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal interviewed&nbsp;<em>Greg Christie</em>&nbsp;, one of the software engineers in charge of developing the&nbsp;first iPhone&nbsp;, something always interesting considering that&nbsp;<em>Apple is not particularly open</em>&nbsp;to telling things about its work teams, nor for letting the members communicate with the media.</p>
<h2>Secrecy within Apple, and a very small team</h2>
<p>Christie jumped on the "&nbsp;<strong>Purple</strong>&nbsp;" project train - before it was iPhone - at the invitation of Scott Forstall, and worked on well-known elements such as "slide to unlock", or the famous bounce when you reach the end of a screen with offset.</p>
<p>Although no specific details are given about the number of members of the project, it does make it clear that&nbsp;<em>the number of people was very small</em> , too much for something so important, and Apple's possibilities.</p>
<p>Another important detail was the secrecy, even among members of the company.&nbsp;He had&nbsp;<em>two monthly meetings with Steve Jobs</em>&nbsp;to show him the progress, and few people had access to those meetings in the development room, which you can see in the images.&nbsp;Information was encrypted and access was restricted.</p>
<p>Early prototypes featured plastic touch screens and were chained to Mac desktops that emulated the operation of a less capable device, such as mobile device hardware.</p>

<p>Steve had great ideas and concepts that he wanted to capture.&nbsp;The bases of the project were the&nbsp;<em>touch screen, no physical buttons</em>&nbsp;, and the possibility of linking the devices with the content playback capabilities of the&nbsp;<em>iPod</em>&nbsp;family , which would end up leading to the store we know.</p>
<p>The boss was initially not too happy with the progress, and even gave&nbsp;<em>an ultimatum</em>&nbsp;, with a two-week window to improve what he saw, or he would change the UI developers.</p>
<p>In the end, it seems that things turned out better than expected, with the approval of other heavyweights such as&nbsp;<em>Jony Ive and Bill Cambell</em>&nbsp;, who even commented that the phone was going to be something bigger than the Mac.</p>
<p>The three personalities&nbsp;<em>approved the project in 2005</em>&nbsp;, and from then on, the complete work took two and a half years of the time of Greg and his colleagues at Apple.&nbsp;Steve Jobs was on top of every little detail that they found along the way.</p>
<p>In the last six months before revealing the phone to the general public, the changes did not stop, with ideas like&nbsp;<strong>a split-screen</strong>&nbsp;view (split view), showing different things.&nbsp;Steve thought that wasn't a great idea for such a small screen.</p>
<p>Apple's opening with this interview may have a lot to do with the fact that at the end of March they have to meet again with Samsung on issues of&nbsp;<em>patents infringed</em>&nbsp;by Koreans, relating to old models.&nbsp;It seems that they want us to remember the great work that his staff has been doing for years.</p>
